"""
Classes objects and OOP

Classes - used for defining new types.

Type - collection of values and operations on those values

UNLIKE Java/c# python uses different contsructs for differnet purposes - you don't need to use classes to do everything
  Standalone variables and functions for storage/behavior
  modules (without classes) building parts
     namespaces
     
Class = type defined with a class statement

Class names usually capitalized, but modules that defined them are not.  PEP8 - naming reccomendation

Instance - a value of a class type
  Often called "object" in other languages.  In Python all values are objects "Instance" distinguishes objects of class types from other objects
